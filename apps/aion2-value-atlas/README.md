# Atreia Atlas — AION 2 Value Intelligence

**Version 0.1.0 · Research snapshot October 9, 2026 (America/New_York).**

**Hosted preview:** https://atreia-atlas-4ko9ii.v2.appdeploy.ai/ (AppDeploy snapshot; separate from an uncreated GitHub remote).

A visual, local/offline-first dashboard for comparing AION 2 Global cash-shop items: Quna packs, bonus A2 Mileage, direct-money cosmetics, passes, persistent convenience, regional patch history and source confidence. Intended for players who prioritize collecting skins and long-term enjoyment over combat meta.

## Open it right now

Open `index.html` in Chrome, Edge, Firefox or Safari. There is **no account login, network dependency, backend or required package installation**. The page uses system font fallbacks and performs no external requests to initialize.

## Features

- Adjustable fashion / playtime / meta preferences and sorted product catalog with source confidence.
- Quna versus Mileage normalized to 4,000/10,000/20,000/40,000 Quna, exact cent math.
- Budget optimizer up to $500 maximizing explicitly weighted Quna + Mileage; the mileage valuation is **your assumption** and adjustable.
- All ten listed A2 Mileage Shop products and their per-character/daily limits.
- Source-linked regional patch timeline, past events vs scheduled dates, community vs official evidence.
- Export source JSON directly from the dashboard.

## Canonical inputs & rebuild

Edit `data/catalog.json` to add sourced product observations, then:

```sh
python scripts/build.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Commit the JSON and generated `index.html` together. `scripts/build.py` validates source references and fails closed on invalid data. Static CI checks generated-byte parity and final embedded JavaScript syntax. The offline `index.html` is deliberately checked into Git for reproducibility and direct browser use.

## Scope, known gaps & responsible use

Initial coverage is **NOT an exhaustive current cash shop** and is not live-updating. Confirm exact products and purchase limits in the actual client. NCSOFT official data and user screenshot are distinguished from community estimates. Unknown direct cash Mileage is null rather than falsely treated as zero. No guarantee that spending Quna itself generates more Mileage. Scores are editorial, not objective arbitrage. Paid skins may be limited to a character/server and do not earn Collection Points.

## Heaven Toolbox alignment

Bootstrapped using `fengie/heaven-toolbox` guidance: `AGENTS.md`, `GLOBAL_GIT_DIRECTIVE.md`, `_AGENT_TRAINING/CONTINUITY_PROTOCOL.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_PIPELINE.md`, `VERIFICATION_DOCTRINE.md`, `APP_AUTOUPDATE_STANDARD.md`. Research and rationale live under `_AGENT_CONTEXT/RESEARCH_FINDINGS/records/2026/10/`. Source contract + test + release timestamps exist. **The AppDeploy live preview is ready with no reported frontend/network QA errors. GitHub repo has not been provisioned, and Heaven updater workflow is not installed.** `.heaven/update-policy.json` is a declared target only; see `NEXT-AGENT-START-HERE.md` for outstanding deployment work.

## Recent patches

- **0.1.0 — 2026-10-09:** Offline dashboard, data-source ledger, Quna pack optimizer, Mileage table and patch radar.
